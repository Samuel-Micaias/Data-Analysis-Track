1. Count - Counts how many times a variable (or value) appears in a string or phrase.

E.g
phrase = "Python is great, and Python is popular."
count_python = phrase.count("Python")
print(count_python)  # Output: 2

2. Len - Identifies the length of a string or phrase, which is the total number of characters it contains, including spaces, punctuation, and special characters.

E.g
phrase = "Python is awesome!"
length = len(phrase)
print(length)  # Output: 18

3. Find - Returns the index (position) of the first occurrence of a specified value in a string or phrase. If the value is not found, it returns -1.

E.g
phrase = "Python is great!"
position = phrase.find("great")
print(position)  # Output: 10

4. Replace - Replaces occurrences of a specified substring with another substring in a string or phrase.

E.g
phrase = "Python is great!"
new_phrase = phrase.replace("great", "awesome")
print(new_phrase)  # Output: "Python is awesome!"

5. Upper - Converts all characters in a string to uppercase (capital letters).

E.g 
phrase = "Python is great!"
uppercase_phrase = phrase.upper()
print(uppercase_phrase)  # Output: "PYTHON IS GREAT!"

6. Lower - Converts all characters in a string to lowercase (small letters).

E.g
phrase = "Python is GREAT!"
lowercase_phrase = phrase.lower()
print(lowercase_phrase)  # Output: "python is great!"

7. Capitalize - Capitalizes (makes the first letter uppercase) the first character of a string, and converts all other characters to lowercase.

E.g 
phrase = "python is great!"
capitalized_phrase = phrase.capitalize()
print(capitalized_phrase)  # Output: "Python is great!"

8. Title - Capitalizes the first letter of each word in a string and converts all other letters to lowercase.

E.g
phrase = "python is great and fun!"
title_phrase = phrase.title()
print(title_phrase)  # Output: "Python Is Great And Fun!"

9. Strip - Removes leading and trailing whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) from a string.

E.g
phrase = "   Python is great!   "
stripped_phrase = phrase.strip()
print(stripped_phrase)  # Output: "Python is great!"

10. Rstrip - Removes trailing whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) from the right side of a string.

E.g
phrase = "Python is great!   "
right_stripped_phrase = phrase.rstrip()
print(right_stripped_phrase)  # Output: "Python is great!"

11. Lstrip - Removes leading whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) from the left side of a string.

E.g 
phrase = "   Python is great!"
left_stripped_phrase = phrase.lstrip()
print(left_stripped_phrase)  # Output: "Python is great!"

12. Split - Splits a string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter (by default, it splits by whitespace)

E.g 
phrase = "Python is great and fun!"
split_phrase = phrase.split()
print(split_phrase)  # Output: ['Python', 'is', 'great', 'and', 'fun!']

13. Join - Joins elements of an iterable (such as a list or tuple) into a single string, using a specified separator.

E.g
words = ['Python', 'is', 'great', 'and', 'fun!']
joined_phrase = ' '.join(words)
print(joined_phrase)  # Output: "Python is great and fun!"
